Jquery homework assignment 


The game begins with a randomized number set as the Given Value. Your objective is to match this value with your Running Total without going over. 

Running total gets updated whenever you click on a crystal. Each crystal is assigned a random value, which is unknown to you. Clicking on a crystal adds that value to your Running Total. The values of each of the crystals changes when you hit reset, as does your Given Value. 

You win everytime you match the Running Total to the Given Value. You lose everytime the Running Total goes over the Given Value.
